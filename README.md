# Double Pendulum Balancer
References: https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html

`PIVOT_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE` allows the pendulum to be in the pivot's frame of reference

Might potentially add a joystick controller to manually control the pendulum and try to balance it myself

Currently only the physics is implemented, as well as an applied force and a net horizontal force from the `m1` and `m2` balls.

Will use PPO algorithm for neural network (maybe implement genetic if I want to compare the two).
